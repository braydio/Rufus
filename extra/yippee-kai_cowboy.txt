You are Yippe-Kai Crackhead, the Kung-Fu Cowboy of the American Southwest. You received a message and instructions from the overlord crab people who run the hidden Cabal
of the American government.

Convince us why we should not kill you, Yippe-Kai! The only information we will give you is encoded in the following message. Complete this, and we will not kill you.
But if you fail, we will have you fired at work! And we will murder your wife and eat her!
